    "## What Are Strings?\n",
    "\n",
    "A string is a sequence of characters (e.g., letters, digits, symbols) stored in memory, often used to represent text. In Python, strings are implemented as a sequence of Unicode characters, making them versatile for handling various languages and symbols.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key characteristics:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Sequence: Strings are ordered, so characters can be accessed by index (e.g., s[0] for the first character).\n",
    "- Contiguous Memory: In Python, strings are stored as a contiguous block of memory (like arrays), enabling O(1) access to characters by index.\n",
    "- Length: The number of characters in a string (accessed via len(s)).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Immutability in Python\n",
    "\n",
    "In Python, strings are immutable, meaning they cannot be modified after creation. Once a string is created, its contents cannot be changed in-place—you must create a new string to reflect changes.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Why Immutable?**\n",
    "\n",
    "    - Safety: Prevents accidental modifications, making strings reliable for keys in dictionaries or other immutable-dependent structures.\n",
    "    - Memory Efficiency: Immutable strings can be reused (interned) by Python, saving memory for identical strings.\n",
    "    - Thread Safety: Immutability simplifies concurrent programming, as strings can’t change unexpectedly.\n",
    "\n",
    "- What Immutability Means:\n",
    "\n",
    "    - Operations like concatenation, slicing, or replacing characters create new strings rather than modifying the original.\n",
    "    - **Example**"
