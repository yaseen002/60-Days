On Day 3, I delved into string fundamentals in Data Structures and Algorithms, learning about string immutability in Python, common string operations, and the basics of substring searching, while also practicing with the Valid Palindrome problem. For my DSA project, I built an Anagram Checker to determine if two strings are anagrams. In AI, I continued exploring linear algebra, focusing on matrix multiplication rules, matrix transposition, and the concepts of identity and inverse matrices. My AI project involved creating a Matrix Transformer to compute the transpose of a matrix and perform scalar multiplication. Additionally, I applied architectural tips to write cleaner code and practiced explaining the concept of a matrix in simple terms to a non-technical audience, enhancing my communication skills.
