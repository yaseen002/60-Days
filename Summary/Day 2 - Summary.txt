Today, I explored the fundamentals of arrays in Data Structures and Algorithms, learning about their memory layout and key operations like insertion, deletion, and searching, while also starting to grasp the sliding window technique. In AI, I began studying linear algebra, focusing on scalars, vectors, and matrices, and practiced matrix addition, scalar multiplication, and the dot product to build intuition for vector operations. For my projects, I worked on an Array Stats Calculator to compute the minimum, maximum, mean, and median of a number list and a Vector Similarity Checker to calculate the dot product and cosine similarity of two vectors. Additionally, I noted architectural tips like using meaningful variable names and adhering to the DRY principle to write cleaner, more efficient code.
